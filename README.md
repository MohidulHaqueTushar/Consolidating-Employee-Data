# Consolidating-Employee-Data
## Use DataFrames to read and merge employee data from different sources.

**Project Description:**

Wouldn't it be great if the data was stored in favorite format, ready to be analyzed? Unfortunately, that's rarely the case. Data comes in different formats, and being able to merge these different sources in a single file for analysis is a fundamental skill for any data practitioner.

In this project, import employee and human resources data in CSV, Excel, and JSON format, then merge it all into a single DataFrame, before cleaning it so that it is ready for use in your business.

**Project Tasks:**

Tidy and join multiple datasets to build a single view of employee information!
